    description: "The menacing SRT Viper is a two-passenger, race-bred grand touring car powered by an 8.4-litre V10 engine that produces a prodigious 645 horsepower and 600 lb.-ft. of torque. The Tremec six-speed manual transmission is the lone offering, so if you don’t like to shift your own gears, the Viper is not for you. The car’s frame uses high-strength steel, magnesium, aluminum and carbon fibre to enhance rigidity. Handling is exceptional. Viper has a four-wheel independent suspension, Brembo brakes, Sabelt clamshell seats, an advanced electronic stability control system, and even a dedicated launch control program."

    description: "The company’s pedigree in modern drop-top grand tourers like the new Ferrari Portofino is, shall we say, somewhat less convincing. It introduced the Portofino's predecessor, the original folding hard-top California – its answer to the Mercedes-AMG SL63 and Porsche 911 Turbo cabriolet – ten years ago. But straight away it became clear that The Prancing Horse was dipping an elegant equine ankle into waters that couldn’t even be thought vaguely familiar, even with the existence of likes of the 575M Superamerica and Daytona Spyder nestled deep in its back catalogue."

Advances in battery technology and the like mean EVs have come a very long way since then, yet somehow the Model S still does the business. It stills feels fresh – to drive and live with.'
